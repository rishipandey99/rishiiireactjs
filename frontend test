7} Here is an example of how you can define the main function and the callback functions cb1 and cb2:

function main(cb1, cb2, x, y) {
  const result1 = cb1(x, y);
  const result2 = cb2(x, y);
  console.log(`Result of cb1: ${result1}`);
  console.log(`Result of cb2: ${result2}`);
}

// Define cb1 to add two numbers
function cb1(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

// Define cb2 to find the difference of two numbers
function cb2(x, y) {
  return x - y;
}

// Call the main function with the callback functions and numbers
main(cb1, cb2, 11, 4);

This will output:

Result of cb1: 15
Result of cb2: 7

The main function takes two callback functions cb1 and cb2, and two numbers x and y as parameters. It calls the callback functions with the numbers as arguments, and logs the results to the console.

The cb1 function adds two numbers, and the cb2 function finds the difference between two numbers.
